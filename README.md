Cliqz for iOS 
===============

Download on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/cliqz-browser/id1065837334?mt=8).

The CLIQZ Browser for iOS is originally a fork of [Firefox's iOS Browser](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ios).

This branch
-----------

This branch is a stable branch just before the last release, for up-to-date codes use development branch.

For each released version there is a corresponding tag.

This branch works with Xcode 7.3.1, and supports iOS 8.2 and 9.x. Although you can only run and debug from Xcode on a 9.2.1 device.

Please make sure you aim your pull requests in the right direction.

Getting involved
----------------

We encourage you to participate in this open source project. We love Pull Requests, Bug Reports, ideas, (security) code reviews or any kind of positive contribution.

This is a work in progress on some early ideas.  Don't get too attached to this code. Tomorrow everything will be different.

Likewise, the design and UX is still in flux. Don't get attached to them. They will change tomorrow!

Building the code
-----------------

> __As of March 28, 2016, this project requires Xcode 7.3.__

1. Install the latest [Xcode developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple.
1. Install Carthage

  ```shell
  brew update
  brew install carthage
  ```

1. Clone the repository:

  ```shell
  https://github.com/cliqz-oss/browser-ios/
  ```

1. Pull in the project dependencies:

  ```shell
  cd browser-ios
  sh ./checkout.sh
  ```

1. Open `Client.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
1. Build the `Fennec` scheme in Xcode.

It is possible to use [App Code](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/download/) instead of Xcode, but you will still require the Xcode developer tools.
