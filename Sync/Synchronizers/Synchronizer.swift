 * A Synchronizer is (unavoidably) entirely in charge of what it does within a sync.
 * For example, it might make incremental progress in building a local cache of remote records, never actually performing an upload or modifying local storage.
 * It might only upload data. Etc.
 *
 * Eventually I envision an intent-like approach, or additional methods, to specify preferences and constraints
 * (e.g., "do what you can in a few seconds", or "do a full sync, no matter how long it takes"), but that'll come in time.
 *
 * A Synchronizer is a two-stage beast. It needs to support synchronization, of course; that
 * needs a completely configured client, which can only be obtained from Ready. But it also
 * needs to be able to do certain things beforehand:
 *
 * * Wipe its collections from the server (presumably via a delegate from the state machine).
 * * Prepare to sync from scratch ("reset") in response to a changed set of keys, syncID, or node assignment.
 * * Wipe local storage ("wipeClient").
 *
 * Those imply that some kind of 'Synchronizer' exists throughout the state machine. We *could*
 * pickle instructions for eventual delivery next time one is made and synchronizedâ€¦
