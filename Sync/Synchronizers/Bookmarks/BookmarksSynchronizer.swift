/**
 * The merger takes as input an existing storage state (mirror and local override),
 * a buffer of new incoming records that relate to the mirror, and performs a three-way
 * merge.
 *
 * The merge itself does not mutate storage. The result of the merge is conceptually a
 * tuple: a new mirror state, a set of reconciled + locally changed records to upload,
 * and two checklists of buffer and local state to discard.
 *
 * Typically the merge will be complete, resulting in a new mirror state, records to
 * upload, and completely emptied buffer and local. In the case of partial inconsistency
 * this will not be the case; incomplete subtrees will remain in the buffer. (We don't
 * expect local subtrees to ever be incomplete.)
 *
 * It is expected that the caller will immediately apply the result in this order:
 *
 * 1. Upload the remote changes, if any. If this fails we can retry the entire process.
 *
 * 2(a). Apply the local changes, if any. If this fails we will re-download the records
 *       we just uploaded, and should reach the same end state.
 *       This step takes a timestamp key from (1), because pushing a record into the mirror
 *       requires a server timestamp.
 *
 * 2(b). Switch to the new mirror state. If this fails, we should find that our reconciled
 *       server contents apply neatly to our mirror and empty local, and we'll reach the
 *       same end state.
 *
 *       Mirror state is applied in a sane order to respect relational constraints, even though
 *       we configure sqlite to defer constraint validation until the transaction is committed.
 *       That means:
 *
 *       - Add any new records in the value table.
 *       - Change any existing records in the value table.
 *       - Update structure.
 *       - Remove records from the value table.
 *
 * 3. Apply buffer changes. We only do this after the mirror has advanced; if we fail to
 *    clean up the buffer, it'll reconcile neatly with the mirror on a subsequent try.
 *
 * 4. Update bookkeeping timestamps. If this fails we will download uploaded records,
 *    find they match, and have no repeat merging work to do.
 *
 * The goal of merging is that the buffer is empty (because we reconciled conflicts and
 * updated the server), our local overlay is empty (because we reconciled conflicts and
 * applied our changes to the server), and the mirror matches the server.
 *
 * Note that upstream application is robust: we can use XIUS to ensure that writes don't
 * race. Buffer application is similarly robust, because this code owns all writes to the
 * buffer. Local and mirror application, however, is not: the user's actions can cause
 * changes to write to the database before we're done applying the results of a sync.
 * We mitigate this a little by being explicit about the local changes that we're flushing
 * (rather than, say, `DELETE FROM local`), but to do better we'd need change detection
 * (e.g., an in-memory monotonic counter) or locking to prevent bookmark operations from
 * racing. Later!
